  <h2>About me</h2>

    <img src="betty.jpg">

    <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three
      widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.
      The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux
      (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose
      Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea
      Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the
      bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot
      episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles
      Levin), who was subsequently removed. The three were soon
      joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle
      Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady
      Pines, burned down.</p>
